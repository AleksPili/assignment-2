          Every now and then, there are new modalities, new ways of being and understanding our world. This invention my invention will change everything. For the better, one hopes. But the good of the scorpion is not the good of the frog, yes? (laughing) (coughing) You must excuse me. I've grown quite weary. Come on. Finally, my friends, at long last the day has come. We have the means, the understanding, the technology... to allow spiders to talk with cats!

        “All along the line,' said the volunteer, pulling the blanket over him, 'everything in the army stinks of rottenness. Up till now the wide-eyed masses haven't woken up to it. With goggling eyes they let themselves be made into mincemeat and then when they're struck by a bullet they just whisper, "Mummy!" Heroes don't exist, only cattle for the slaughter and the butchers in the general staffs. But in the end every body will mutiny and there will be a fine shambles. Long live the army! Goodnight!”

        <p>"What the fuck happened to the Delta I used to know? Where's the spirit? Where's the guts, huh? This could be the greatest night of our lives, but you're gonna let it be the worst. "Ooh, we're afraid to go with you Bluto, we might get in trouble." Well just kiss my ass from now on! Not me! I'm not gonna take this. Wormer, he's a dead man! Marmalard, dead! Niedermeyer..."
